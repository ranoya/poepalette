# What is POE?

Everyone who uses a modern text editor for coding is familiar with a Command Palette, right? (... right???)

If you don't know what a Command Palette is, it started with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+P (or CMD+SHIFT+P on Macs) on Sublime (or VSCode too) would brings up a modal window where you could just start typing what you need and everything related would appear. The need to wonder where all the options and tools were in the menu have ended there.

When you get used to it, you want everything to start working just like that.

POE is just that for handling all your web bookmarks. I'm sure you have a long list of them, don't you?... going back to the Del.ici.ous days, I assume...

## And that's not all...

POE is also extensible. You can code your own javascript functions to trigger within it, and render whatever you want within it. From the latest news available in the RSS feeds of your favorite websites, to information from other databases that you may find useful.

## Don't worry

Everything is free, and always will be, as long as it is not used for commercial purposes. The code is open source and available on [Github](https://www.github.com/ranoya/poepalette).
